            <p>
                I am a student at the University of California, Riverside currently majoring in computer science. I was born and raised in San Diego, California,
                and have learned to love technology at a young age through various RPGs<wbr> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">Role Playing Games</a>).
                In addition to RPGs, my hobbies include: watching baseball, rugmaking, reading manga, watching anime, listening to music, photography, and traveling.

            <h3>Notable Projects</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Aaron's Virtual Bookstore | <a href="https://github.com/abant006/AaronsVirtualBookstore">Github Link</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Constructed a virtual bookstore which allows users to perform <strong>CRUD</strong> operations on available books.
                            Designed Admin/Customer users that can access different levels and permissions of the bookstore.
                            Created the ability to filter the store list by ascending IDs by using the <strong>selection sort</strong> algorithm.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Arduino Racer Game | <a href="https://github.com/abant006/ArduinoRacerGame">Github Link</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Created a racing game designed for the Arduino which is displayed via a liquid crystal display.
                            Implemented a multi-sync state machine design to tie together generation logic with physical button actuations.
                            Designed a function which utilizes <strong>rand()</strong> to determine if and where an object should/should not be generated.

                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>Can You Escape? | <a href="https://abant006.itch.io/can-you-escape">Itch.io Link</a>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Can You Escape?</b> is an immersive and challenging virtual reality escape room experience comprised of 1 intro room,
                            2 puzzle rooms, and one final room. I have designed and implemented all the puzzles (and mini puzzles) found within the game.
                            Puzzles were designed to resemble the way a user may interact with an escape room in real life.
